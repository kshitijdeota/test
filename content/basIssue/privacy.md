# Privacy

The publishers of British Art Studies fully support the protection of intellectual property and are committed to complying with, and strictly adhering to, all applicable copyright law.

## Author Rights
Authors retain copyright of the content they publish with British Art Studies with no restrictions, while granting the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art and Yale Center for British Art the right to distribute and continue showing the article in perpetuity under the journalâ€™s preferred licence (Creative Commons CC BY-NC International 4.0). Authors may deposit any version, whether pre- or post-publication, to any repository or website.

Authors also consent to copies being stored by third-party digital preservation services including, but not limited to, The National Archives, the Internet Archive, and Portico.

The journal does not impose an embargo period on the redistribution of material.

## Plagiarism
The editors of British Art Studies use the plagiarism detection software Similarity Check to verify the originality of submissions to the journal. Peer reviewers are also asked to consider whether the author of a submission has plagiarised another publication or published the research before.

Plagiarism is understood by the editors as failing to acknowledge the work or contributions of other people. This can include reusing material and paraphrasing material without appropriate citation.

Following the guidelines of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), authors will also be expected to retain documentation for any citations to unpublished work, such as personal communications.

## Third Party Copyright
In many cases, copyright or other proprietary rights for material published in British Art Studies may be held by individuals or entities other than, or in addition to, the authors or the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art. Where materials (text or image-based) published in the journal are still protected by copyright, the author must cite the relevant copyright information when reproducing it and comply with all other terms or restrictions that may be applicable to that material. Our in-house Picture Researcher is often able to assist with obtaining the relevant permissions.

## Fair Dealing
In certain cases, exceptions to copyright that permit limited use of protected works without the permission of the copyright owner may be applied.

On this site, digital copies of resources are made accessible for research for one of the following reasons:

they are in the public domain;
the rights are owned by the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art or the Yale Center for British Art;
we make them accessible under an exception or limitation to UK copyright law, as outlined in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (as amended);
we have permission to make them accessible;
or, there are no known restrictions on use.
We are confident that we have carried out due diligence in our use of copyrighted material as required, but we apologise for any inadvertent infringement of rights.
